<h2>Joining the Lab</h2>

<p>

<A href="interests.html">Our interests</a> range from "wet lab" molecular biology and embryology
work with chick embryos, to genome-scale analyses within and across
organisms, and even on to software development methodologies and open
source software development.  We are interested in working with
computer scientists, biologists, physicists, engineers, and more.

<p>

The lab is opening its doors in summer of 2008, and we will be located
on the third floor of Giltner Hall.

<p>

If you are already an MSU student and would like to visit the lab,
please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> directly.

<p>

If you are interested in applying to MSU to work with Dr. Brown,
please contact him via e-mail with your C.V. and a (short!)
description of what you're interested in doing.

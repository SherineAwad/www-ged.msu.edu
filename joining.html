<h2>Joining the Lab</h2>

<p>

<A href="interests.html">Our interests</a> range from "wet lab"
molecular biology and embryology work with chick embryos, to
genome-scale analyses within and across organisms, and on to software
development practice and open source software development.  We are
interested in working with computer scientists, biologists,
physicists, engineers, and more.

<p>

If you are interested in graduate school, please apply to
MSU <b>before</b> contacting me.  I take PhD students through
the <a href='http://www.cse.msu.edu/~graddir/how2apply.htm'>Computer
Science</a> and
<A href='http://biomolecular.msu.edu/apply.html'>BioMolecular
Science</A> graduate programs, and I am also affiliated
with <a href='http://beacon-center.org/'>the BEACON Center for the
Study of Evolution in
Action</a>, <a href='http://eebb.msu.edu/graduateprogram.html'>the
Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and Behavior graduate program</a>, and
the <a href='http://biomodel.msu.edu/'>Quantitative Biology Graduate
Program</a>.  Note, BEACON and QB do not take graduate students
directly!

<p>

If you are already an MSU student and would like to visit the lab,
please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> directly.

<p>

If you are interested in applying to MSU to work with Dr. Brown,
please contact him via e-mail with your C.V. and a (short!)
description of what you're interested in doing.

<p>

In both cases, please indicate that you have read this Web site by
including the phrase "skylar dragon" in your e-mail. I will use this
to filter out people who don't know how to use google or have too
short an attention span to read my lab Web site thoroughly.

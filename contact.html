<h2>Contact information</h2>

<p>

Please contact Dr. (C.) Titus Brown directly at <a
href="mailto:ctb@msu.edu">ctb@msu.edu</a>.  He spends
most of his time in 2228(C) BPS.

<p>

If you're going to ask him for a recommendation letter, please read
<a href='http://phylogenomics.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/advice-on-asking-for-letters-of-recommendation/'>this blog post by Jonathan Eisen first</a>.  I would like to be asked at least two weeks before the deadline!

<p>

The GED computational lab space is BPS 2228.

<h2>Joining the Lab</h2>

<p>

<A href="research.html">Our research</a> largely centers around
making sense of biological data, which involves working with many
different "wet lab" and field biologists on data analysis from many
different systems.  We are also very interested in sustainable
scientific software development practice and open source software
development. We are interested in working with computer scientists,
biologists, physicists, engineers, and more.

<p>

If you are interested in graduate school, please apply to
MSU <b>before</b> contacting me.  I take PhD students through
the <a href='http://www.cse.msu.edu/~graddir/how2apply.htm'>Computer
Science</a> and
<A href='http://biomolecular.msu.edu/apply.html'>BioMolecular
Science</A> graduate programs, and I am also affiliated
with <a href='http://beacon-center.org/'>the BEACON Center for the
Study of Evolution in
Action</a>, <a href='http://eebb.msu.edu/graduateprogram.html'>the
Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and Behavior graduate program</a>, and
the <a href='http://biomodel.msu.edu/'>Quantitative Biology Graduate
Program</a>.  Note, BEACON and QB do not take graduate students
directly!

<p>

If you are already an MSU student and would like to visit the lab,
please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> directly.

<p>

If you are interested in applying to MSU to work with Dr. Brown,
please contact him via e-mail with your C.V. and a (short!)
description of what you're interested in doing.

<p>

In both cases, please indicate that you have read this Web site by
including the phrase "skylar dragon" in your e-mail. I will use this
to filter out people who don't know how to use google or have too
short an attention span to read my lab Web site thoroughly.

<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<img src="chick-in-shell.jpg" align="right" alt="cute chick in shell">

You have reached the lab for Genomics, Evolution, and Development
(GED) at Michigan State U.  This lab is run by Dr. C. Titus Brown, who
is an assistant professor in the departments of
<a href="http://www.mmg.msu.edu/">Microbiology and Molecular Genetics (MMG)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/">Computer Science and
Engineering (CSE)</a>.
In addition to
<a href='research.html'>his research interests</a>, he <a href='courses/'>teaches a number of
courses</a>.  Dr. Brown also <a href='http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/'>blogs</a> under his nom de plume, Dr. C. Titus Brown.

In recent years, our interests have shifted to the question of how to
use large data sets, especially next-gen sequencing data sets, to
generate the best possible biological hypotheses for subsequent
testing.  We are working in the areas of microbial ecology (with
metagenomics), evo-devo and disease (mRNAseq), and bacterial and
animal genomics.  We are increasingly interested in the question of
how to educate biologists to work with data and tools, and have
invested quite a bit of energy in
a <a href='http://bioinformatics.msu.edu/ngs-summer-course-2012'>summer
course</a> as well
as <a href='http://www.software-carpentry.org'>Software Carpentry</a>
materials.

<p>

The development and extension of data analysis tools and toolkits is
an increasingly large interest of the lab.  We are in dire need of
advanced computational tools for modern biology -- tools for analyzing
data from whole genome sequencing and sequence annotation,
microarrays, ChIP-chip data, massively parallel sequencing, regulatory
genomics, third-party databases, and metagenomic sequences.  As part
of our research we are pushing the interface between investigative
tools and biological science, which will lead to new types of
questions and (hopefully!)  answers to old questions.  In connection
with this research, we are very interested in the process of
developing maintainable and extensible software.
<p>
A central focus of the group is on open source/access/science.

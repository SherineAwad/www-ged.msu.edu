CSE 891 / Spring 2010

Due Tues Feb 9; please print out & hand in in class.

0. Read `peer usage vs peer review <./peer%20usage%20vs%20peer%20review.pdf>`__ and
`the trouble with replication <./trouble%20with%20replication%20nature.pdf>`__.

1. Suppose that you are working with a Korean collaborator on a
large-scale study of gene expression in stem cells and you find that
you cannot replicate her results: you find a completely different set
of genes that are up-regulated under treatment with Prozac than she
does.  What are at least four reasons why this could happen?  (Any
type of reason is fine -- computational, experimental, ethical, etc.)
And for each of the four reasons, how would you figure out whether
or not that particular reason was the (or at least a) reason behind
the difference?

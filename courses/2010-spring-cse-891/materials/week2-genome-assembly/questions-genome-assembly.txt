Questions on genome assembly
----------------------------

Due Tuesday, Feb 2nd, at the start of class.

0. Read the sea urchin genome paper
(http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/314/5801/941) and the
Ciona polymorphic assembly paper
(http://genome.cshlp.org/content/15/8/1127.long).

Answer #1, and either #2 or #3:

1. How is the N50 number determined for genomic contigs, and what is one
reason why it is important?  What is one strategy for improving the N50?

2. Think about the various polymorphism handling approaches in the
Ciona paper discussion section and name at least one advantage and one
disadvantage of the approach.

3. How does the CAPSS strategy used in sea urchin sequencing address
concerns of high polymorphism (equiv. heterozygosity) in the sea urchin
genome?

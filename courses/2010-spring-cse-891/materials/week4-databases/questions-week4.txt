Questions on Genome Annotation

CSE 891 / Spring 2010

Due Tues Feb 9; please print out & hand in in class.

0. Read http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v9/n9/abs/nrg2414.html and
and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1891709/ (the whole
paper).

1.  In Lincoln Stein's paper on integration biological databases, he
identifies three kinds of integration approaches.  Suppose you were
setting up a lab and wanted to put together an in-lab system to help
you correlate your own private data (gene sequencing, knockouts and
mutations, strains, etc.)  with public data.  Which of Lincoln Stein's
three strategies do you think would be a good strategy for such a
per-lab system to use (and why)?

2. Pick one of the first four main computational approaches to
determining protein function computationally, and discuss a potential
drawback, either for your organism(s) of interest or with respect to
the computational technique used.

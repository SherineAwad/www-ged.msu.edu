Next-generation Sequencing
--------------------------

Apr 8th, 2010

CSE 891

--

Sanger sequencing - cloning, growing, etc.

Bias issues: going thru bacteria.

Scales poorly.

Read length ~900 bp

Used for most sequencing to date, still used for nasty whole-genome
sequencing.

New technologies
================

New technologies emerge over the last few years.

the primary basic strategy (454, Illumina, SOLiD, Polonator)

 - Isolate individual DNA molecules
 - Use PCR to generate "PCR colonies", or polonies
 - Replicate one more time, but with fluorescent nucleotides
 - Image at each nucleotide addition

454
---

Most mature technology, along with Solexa.

Prone to errors in reading long homopolymer runs.

Paired-end sequencing: one strategy is circularization, selection,
digestion, sequencing from new ligated pairs.

Titanium read stats: 500 bp mode, 400k (?) reads

~$10k

Solexa(/Illumina)
-----------------

Very mature.

Immobilization and growth on solid substrate.

25-40m reads, 25-40 bp.  Soon up to 70bp?

Paired-end is readily available.

~$10k

SOLiD
-----

Ligation-based sequencing

Construct oligos with mostly "wild cards" and all possible 2-mers in
the middle ::
 
    NNNNNNNNNNN-AA-NNNNNNNNNNN
    NNNNNNNNNNN-AT-NNNNNNNNNNN
    NNNNNNNNNNN-AC-NNNNNNNNNNN
    NNNNNNNNNNN-AG-NNNNNNNNNNN
    NNNNNNNNNNN-TA-NNNNNNNNNNN

and label each one with a different fluorescent tag.  Ligate.  The tag
that shows up in a particular polony tells you what sequence is in the
middle.

Helicos
-------

Not polony based -- single-molecule sequencing.

poly-A tail immobilization followed by fluorescent "quad" incorporation &
imaging.

25-90 megabase/hr according to PR

20 Gb/run.

Polonator
---------

"Open source" polony machine: open hardware, open software. You pay for
the hardware and get full instructions on modification.

Currently mainly for biochemistry enthusiasts :)

Pacific Biosciences
-------------------

Not polony based -- single molecule sequencing.

Image actual polymerase putting tags on.  Not in production yet, but
promises to deliver ~1-10kb reads, circular.

The only sequencing technique that may not have nonsense-read problems.

What use are these techniques?
==============================

Cheap!

Massively parallel.

Easily (?) scalable.

Many, many simultaneous samples.

...but?
-------

Shorter reads (tho improving).

Error models & biases not well understood.

Substantial number of "error" reads (mixed polonies, etc.?)

Can now generate more data than can easily be analyzed.

Uses
----

Re-sequencing: looking for SNPs, copy number variation, indels, etc.

Large-scale RNA sequencing

Counting molecules: useful for

 - expression assay
 - ChIP assay
 - overlap assay (?)

Sequencing "from the wild", or environmental sequencing

Genome sequencing?

--

Thinking about use & features:

 - for indels (insertion-deletion analysis), want long reads OR paired-end
   reads

 - for de novo sequencing, longer reads are better: otherwise no way to
   identify sequence, because you can't map it to known genome.

 - for *counting*, as long as reads long enough to be mappable, want
   as many samples as possible.  (Think stddev.)

Computational analysis of all this data is still a tricky business.
(...because algorithms seldom scale linearly with the amount of data to
be analyzed.)

So is storage -- quote from ABI rep, paraphrased: "we discard the
raw image data after initial processing into sequence, because storing
the raw data is more expensive than re-running the sample."

Analysis
--------

Assembly is a bitch.

Mapping can be a problem for short reads, too.

 - cannot map across even tiny repetitive elements w/o paired end

 - "nonsense" reads confuse the situation: if 40% of the reads aren't
   mappable...??

Quite a bit of mapping and analysis software out there, but it's all
hard to use :)

Vast amounts of data are difficult for biologists to deal with, and
complicate things for computational people too.

Why isn't mapping in-del aware?
-------------------------------

Naive versus slightly smarter sequence matching.

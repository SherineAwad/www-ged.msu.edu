Basic molecular biology
-----------------------

Central dogma: ::

  DNA -> RNA -> protein

(99% truth :)

DNA -> RNA is "transcription", off of genomic DNA into RNA, by polymerase.
("RNA pol II", typically.)

In prokaryotes, RNA is transcribed and then translated unmodified.

In eukaryotes, nuclear RNA is spliced, poly-A(denylated), and exported
into the cytoplasm as "messenger" RNA.

Ribosomes then translate mRNA into protein.

At each stage, points of regulation and modification:

 - regulation of transcriptional initiation
 - regulation of transcriptional "pausing"
 - regulation of splicing of nuclear RNA (euk)
 - regulation of poly-A and export (euk)
 - differential degradation of mRNA
 - differential rate of translation initiation (mRNA -> protein)
 - post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, for example)
 - differential stability of protein
 - localization of proteins to different components of the cytoplasm
     (nuclear vs cytoplasm vs cell wall vs export...)

Some portions of mRNA are not translated ("untranslated regions", UTRs)

Orientation of DNA: 5' ("left") and 3' ("right"), so 5' and 3' UTRs.

Triplet code: 64 triplet codons; 24 amino acids, plus 3 "stop" codons:
TAG, TGA, TAA.

Redundancy tends to be in third base of codon: ::

  Leucine (L) is coded for by

     TTA
     TTG
     CTT
     CTC
     CTA
     CTG

this leads to "third base wobble" where mutations in third base of
codons are selectively neutral, and hence can be used to assess rates
of molecular evolution, among other things.

Sequence Signals
----------------

Much of the above regulation etc. is accomplished via signals in the
genomic DNA (and on messages, and in proteins).

Biochemical signals:

 - on DNA, methylation: CG -> CpG, p == methyl group
 - on chromatin (DNA + histone proteins; eukaryotic) acetylation

Sequence signals may or may not target biochemical modifications, but
they definitely target other stuff.  For example:

"promoter", transcriptional initiation site; weak & abundant genomic
signals that nonetheless are often present for polymerase to bind.

 - bacteria, -35 and -10 sequences lie (yes) 35 and 10 bases from
   transcript start site
 - TATA box (yes, "T, A, T, A") and many others, proximal to start
   of eukaryotic transcripts.

Kozak sequence - ``(gcc)gccRccAUGG`` - place where ribosome binds to
(eukaryotic) message (RNA) to start translation, proximal to and
upstream of ATG.

"Strength" of fuzzy signals matters: strong Kozak sequences drive more
translation per mRNA, for example.  Stronger promoters -> more
transcription.

Protein-coding genes always start with ATG (codes for methionine, M).

Where da genes at?
------------------



Prokaryotes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's 5 million base pairs of DNA from a prokaryotic genome?
Where are all the protein coding genes?

(Fact: typically prokaryotes are ~80% protein coding, and typical
genome size is around 5 mb.)

Well,

 - every gene starts with an ATG and ends with a stop codon (one of
   three triplets)
 - why not just look for those?

"Open Reading Frames" (ORF) == things that look like they could be genes
because they have an ATG and don't have any stop codons for a while.

Hmm, what's statistically significant in an ORF?? ::

  p(generating a stop codon) = 3/64
  p(not generating a stop codon) = 1 - 3/64

  p(3L-length sequence doesn't have a stop codon) = 1 - (1 - 3/64)^L

    which expands to

  p(3L-length sequence doesn't have a stop codon) = 3L / 64

so if you see an ATG followed by, say, 100 non-stop codons, it's
statistically unlikely to have been generated at random.

Conveniently genes are often ~500bp or longer (> ~120 aa)... but you
still miss short genes this way.  Unclear how big a problem that is.

OK, so, in prokaryotic genomes you can pretty much just look for
things that could be genes based on sequence signals and statistics,
and "guess".

And ... that's just what you do!  See "Glimmer" paper.

Aside: when you have a clear **statistical signature**, life is good.
Valid coding, of a certain length, starting with ATG... etc.

Eukaryotes
~~~~~~~~~~

Eukaryotic genomes are much, much, much larger than prokaryotic genomes:

 * C elegans - 100mb
 * Drosophila - 200mb
 * Sea urchin - 800mb
 * Chicken - 1.2gb
 * Human - 3gb

...and yet C. elegans and Drosophila have fewer genes than sea urchin,
and chicken and human have approximately the same!)

~20k genes, +/- 5k, in an animal genome.  Where does that leave us in
genomic sequence / gene?

(Celera share price... heh.)

Genes are not necessarily *significantly* longer in eukaryotes than in
prokaryotes (variance is higher, that's all).

Remember splice step?

genome -> nuclear RNA -> (spliced) mRNA -> protein.

In practice much of the genomic DNA in the larger genomes is:

 - complex intergenic (larger inter-gene regions), both non-functional
   and functional (talk about this later)

 - intronic (inbetween "exons", protein coding sections of genes on genomic
   DNA)

 - repetitive intergenic sequence.

Have to take into account **splice sites** when you think about eukaryotic
genes!

Splice donor: ::

   [CG]GT[AG]

Splice acceptor: ::

   AAGG

...but these aren't very long and hence aren't very specific.

Gene finders are lousy at finding UTRs, too... no clear statistical
signature!

Can also improve gene finding algorithms by incorporating
evolutionary evidence (alignments etc.) - see Twinscan paper.

But... what *is* a gene, anyway?
--------------------------------

Genetic "locus" vs protein coding gene: two ends of spectrum.

Genetics defined genes as "things that have a measurable phenotype when
you poke them.", a.k.a. genetic loci.

Molecular biologists defined genes as "things that code for proteins".

The more we know the more confused we get (typical for biology).

 - genetic loci can include things like regulatory control sequences
   that fit no one's definition of a "gene" -- more of a traffic signal
   than an actual actor.

 - there are many more molecular "actors" than just things that code
   for proteins, like RNAs that regulate other RNAs.  (non-coding RNA
   is probably the most inclusive term; more later in class.)

So, for this week, "gene" == "protein coding gene that fits majority
preconceptions".

The real secret to gene finding
-------------------------------

If you have a genomic sequence but have no more money (see below), then
you can often go by **sequence similarity** or homology.

Basically,

 - take all known genes from other genomes
 - use a sequence search algorithm to look for things that are similar
 - note that you want to look for *protein* similarity, not nt similarity --
   codon wobble.

BLAST works by identifying significant points of similarity and then expanding
out from there.  (We can talk about this in more detail later if people want.)

A few problems, though:

 - you only find things that you already knew about.
 - fast-evolving genes may escape your search because they don't look
   like anything else.
 - may not find precise positions of introns/exons, which can be important
   for other kinds of purposes (ncRNA analysis, for example).

Even genes that have nearly identical function can look quite different
at the protein sequence level: it's structure that matters, not sequence.
(Recurring theme.)  Genes with sequence similarity as low as 20% may still
be homologs... how to find?

Can also use "profile" searches that take into account positions of
key amino acids, but these are limited to specific protein domains,
rather than exons etc.

Combine evidence: look for homology and splice sites and run several
gene finders, then ask for "consensus" on what's a gene.

The real secret to gene finding, part 2.
----------------------------------------

Eukaryotic gene finders are *so* unreliable that you basically don't
use them on respectable genomes.  (See SNAP paper.)

So, just sequence all the RNA!

ESTs/cDNA sequencing: select poly-A mRNA in the cytoplasm, sequence!

"ESTs" == expressed sequence tags, partial & low-quality sequencing
reads off of (DNA-translated) mRNA.

"cDNA", often "full-length cDNA" == higher-quality, multiple reads
from (DNA-translated) mRNA.

You still miss other kinds of non-protein coding genes (ncRNA): can
devise biochemical ways to isolate and enrich those genes.

You also miss genes that aren't expressed when you're looking!  Or
are difficult to reverse transcribe from RNA back into DNA.  Or that
degrade really quickly, or exist at low expression levels.  Or are really
short. Or ...

This is why you want to *combine* computation and experiment.

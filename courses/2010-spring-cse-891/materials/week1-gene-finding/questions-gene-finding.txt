Questions on gene finding papers
--------------------------------

Due Tuesday, Jan 19th, at the start of class.

(Please answer the questions with at least a short paragraph.  Try to
justify your answer; it doesn't have to be "correct" but I'd like a sense
of your thought process.)

0. Read the SNAP (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/59) and
GLIMMER papers (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/papers/glimmer2.pdf).

1. The sensitivity and specificity of the SNAP gene finder was
measured on several genomes and compared to the performance of
several other gene finders.  Why are the nucleotide numbers generally
so much better than the exon numbers, and the exon numbers better
than the gene numbers?

2. Consider the improvement of GLIMMER 2.0 over GLIMMER 1.0 with
respect to resolving overlapping genes.  Given what you know about
gene start signals, and the description of how GLIMMER's parameters
are estimated from training data, what is the most likely cause of the
"false positives" for gene start signals?

Connecting sequence to biology
------------------------------

So we have some sequence, usually genomic.  Perhaps lots of it.

And we want to know how a particular disease or condition "works" so
that we can "fix" it.

We've talked about:

 - finding genes and ncRNAs
 - connection gene to (putative) function
 - looking at gene expression
 - finding variation in genomes

but the end goal is to move towards a knowledge of *function*.

Function requires many genes working together!

So inevitably you start talking about networks of genes.

Lots and lots of genes.

The Magic Bullet hypothesis (discredited)
=========================================

There's a fat gene!

There's a kidney gene!

Explanation: necessity vs sufficiency.

 - e.g. polII  vs chromatin vs tissue-specific transcription factor

(...and what makes something interesting?)

What do gene networks look like?
================================

Feed forward.

Feed back.

Redundancy.

What do you do with a big network with lots of connections??

Drunks, and street lamps
========================

Ease of measuring something leads to lots of measurements of that thing.

Stripped of context or hypothesis ==> ??

So we have lots of certain kinds of data (protein-protein interaction,
microarrays, genome sequences etc.) and lots of people dedicated to
producing more of it, but (repetitious, I know) intelligent analysis
capability is lacking.

Correlation vs causality; shadow effects
========================================

Have genomic change that is in 1000/1000 people who have six toes, and no
others.

Is it responsible for making six toes?

 - are they closely related?
 - how narrowly have you pinpointed the effect, genomically?

Have expression difference that is in 1000/1000 people with six toes.

Is *it* responsible?

Looking for both gives you increased predictive power.  Why?

cis-regulatory gene networks
============================

Binding sites provide direct evidence of interaction, that is easily
testable / falsifiable.

But:

 computational methods don't work that well at pinpointing binding sites

 redundancy in binding sites

 necessity vs sufficiency again.

 not everything is transcriptional regulation (but a lot of time that's all
 we're looking at anyway, that and post-transcriptional, with microarrays)

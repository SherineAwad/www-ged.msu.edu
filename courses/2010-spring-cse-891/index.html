<h3>Overview</h3>

CSE 891, section 002; spring 2010, Tu/Th 12:40 PM - 2:00 PM, 1300 Engineering.

<p>

One 80 minute lecture, 2 x 40 minute student presentations each week
(3 credits).

<p>

Prerequisites: graduate standing in the natural sciences and/or engineering, OR
permission of instructor.

<p>

An override is necessary for non-Egr graduate students; please send
your PID and NetID to Dr. Brown, ctb@msu.edu.

<p>

This course will introduce biologists to computational considerations,
and computational scientists to biological considerations, in the
context of modern biological "grand challenges".  Likely topics for
2010 will include metagenomics, non-coding RNAs, genome sequencing and
assembly, and next-generation sequencing (e.g. 454, Illumina, SOLiD,
and Helicos).

<p>

Additional potential topics: genome-scale alignments; RNAi/ncRNA; gene
finding; whole-genome phylogenetics; protein structure; databases,
data integration, and data warehousing.

<p>

The course will be graded on homework, attendance, participation, and
presentation.

<p>

Please be sure to do the reading and homework even if you must miss a
class.

<h4>Homework</h4>

Each week 1-3 papers will be assigned on Thursday for everyone to
read, along with several questions to answer in brief by the next
Tuesday.  These homeworks won't be graded for correctness but rather
for engagement -- did you read the paper?  What were points that
confused or enlightened you?  What do you think of the scientific
arguments made in the paper?  You will be expected to discuss your
answers in class.

<h4>Presentations</h4>

Each graduate student will be expected to present at least one paper,
chosen by mutual agreement between the instructor and the student.

<h4>Web site and mailing list</h4>

Reading assignments and homework will be made available through the
mailing list and on the Web site.

<p>

Please sign up for the <a href="http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/cse891-spring-2010">class mailing list</a>.  You can send e-mail to the entire mailing list
at <a href='mailto:cse891@lists.idyll.org'>cse891@lists.idyll.org</a>.

<p>

The mailing list archives are <a href='http://lists.idyll.org/pipermail/cse891-spring-2010/'>available here</a>.

<p>

The first homework and reading assignment will be sent out on Thursday, so please be sure to sign up for the mailing list by then.

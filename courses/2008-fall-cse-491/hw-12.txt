Homework 12
-----------

Due Friday, November 21st, at 5pm.

Please put everything under homework12/ in the root of your svn.
Rather than creating and adding a new directory, please try doing an
'svn copy': ::

   svn copy http://class.ged.idyll.org/$username/homework11/ \
            http://class.ged.idyll.org/$username/homework12/

and then do an 'svn update' to update your working copy with the
new homework12/ subdirectory.  Please talk to me ASAP if you need
some help getting your homework11 directory in shape!

**Note:** Up to one point will be *removed* from your HW score if you
don't name things properly.  I can't figure out any other way to,
ahem, encourage people to not waste my time by hiding their homework
solutions in weird places.

Cleaning up Subversion
----------------------

(1 point)

Clean up your Subversion archive under homework12/ by removing all of
your .pyc files, twill, and any IMDB data files you may have lying
around.  Make sure that everything necessary to run your Web server
and pass the various tests (including the weird user name tests) is
present in Subversion; you might consider doing a clean checkout of a
new working copy to make sure...
 
Creating and loading users & movie databases; fix movie search
--------------------------------------------------------------

(1.5 points)

Write a script 'create-db.py' that takes two arguments, ::

   create-db.py actors-filename actresses-filename

and loads these files into the database 'webserve-info.db'.
The script should assume that webserve-info.db doesn't exist
already and do things like create the necessary user and session
tables, too.

Then make sure that movie search works reasonably well on some
sizeable data: for this, you can use the files in

   ~ctb/imdb-data/

on the CSE cluster.  Please don't check copies of big files, or big
databases, into your svn archive.

Remember to think about the various things I mentioned in lecture #13:
use temporary local space to do tests on big files, etc.

Some JavaScript programming
---------------------------

(2.5 points)

Add some JavaScript code to search-for-movies.html to check the
contents of the form before submission.  Your JS should check to make
sure that both actor and actress are non-empty, and if they are both
filled in, let the submit proceed.  If either one is empty then put in
a note on the page saying that both have to be filled in before
submission.  (Please don't use an alert box or a popup of any kind --
just make a red-colored text note appear.)

Then write a Selenium test called 'MovieFormTest.html' to check that
this message appears whenever either form field is empty.  Place this
test file in files/tests/ and link it into the rest of your Selenium
tests.

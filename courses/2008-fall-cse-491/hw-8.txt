Homework 8: Speaking SQL
------------------------

Due Thursday, Oct 23rd, at 12:40pm (lab start).

Acquire the sqlite database at

    http://class.ged.idyll.org/svn/files/hw-8/webserve-info.db

The database schema has a table 'users' containing username/password
pairs: ::

  CREATE TABLE users (username TEXT NOT NULL, password TEXT NOT NULL);

Change your authentication code to authenticate by checking **both**
username and password against the contents of this table.  (1 point)

Also, provide a Python function accessible directly from webserve.py
that adds users; the function should be named 'add_user', and it
should take a username and a password and add them to your local copy
of the sqlite database.  (1 point)

You should make sure that all of the unit tests in this file

    http://class.ged.idyll.org/svn/files/hw-8/webserve-test.py   

pass; I've updated them to include tests for add_user.  (1 point)

Now create a new file, webserve-user-tests.py, in the homework8/
subdirectory.  These tests should be unit tests (i.e. in the same
format as webserve-test.py) that check to make sure that usernames
can contain strange characters like these:

  '!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~'

*in addition to* a-z, A-Z, and 0-9.  The tests must rely only on the
"public" API of webserve, that is, they should only use
``handle_connection``, ``delegate``, and ``add_user`` -- **not** any
intermediate functions you may have written.  (1 point)

Finally, make sure that the auth functionality (login/logout, password
checking, etc.) works properly with Firefox.  (1 point)

I'm running an example Web server that passes all the tests here:

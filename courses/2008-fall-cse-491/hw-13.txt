Homework 13
-----------

Due Friday, December 5th, at 5pm.

Please put everything under homework13/ in the root of your svn, and
make sure that you can run the site correctly from a fresh checkout, i.e.
that these commands run the correct site: ::

   svn co <...>/homework13/
   cd homework13
   python webserve.py 5000


Logging in with AJAX
--------------------

(3 points)

Write a new login form, available through your Web server as
'/login-js.html', that avoids a full page load and instead uses AJAX
to confirm that the username and password are correct and then to set
the login cookie.

The lab-13 'chat' example at

    http://class.ged.idyll.org/svn/files/lab-13/chat/

shows one possible way to return data from the Web server to JS,
and the file 'cookie-example.html' under

    http://class.ged.idyll.org/svn/files/hw-13/

contains some demo code for setting and retrieving cookies, as does

   http://www.shopdev.co.uk/blog/cookies-with-jquery-designing-collapsible-layouts/

Note, this login code should be compatible with /auth/login -- either
way should result in a session cookie.

Write Selenium tests
--------------------

(2 points)

Write a Selenium test that verifies that the login-js page works for a
correct username/password.  Make sure that the test clears the cookie
first (e.g. by using /auth/logout), and use /auth/print to check that
the correct username/password is returned.

Write another Selenium test that verifies that the login-js page does NOT
set the cookie with an incorrect username/password combination.

Put these tests under 'files/tests/AjaxLoginTestOK.html' and
'files/tests/AjaxLoginTestFail.html', respectively, and link them into
your main Selenium test suite under 'suite.html'.

Oh, and please make sure your Selenium tests work under Firefox!

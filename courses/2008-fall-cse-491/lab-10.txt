figleaf
-------

figleaf is a code coverage recording and analysis tool.  Basically,
it "watches" Python execute code, records which lines are executed,
and then annotates your program with the results.

(I installed it on arctic; you'll need to do ``source ~ctb/python-env.csh``
to be able to run it.)

Basic usage: to record, ::

   figleaf <program> <arguments>

To annotate, ::

   figleaf2html

So, for example, try running ::

   figleaf import_example.py

and then ::

   figleaf2html

Now open the 'html/index.html' file in your browser to see what lines of
code were executed.

Coverage info is saved in the file ``.figleaf``, and automatically aggregated;
to start fresh, rm this file.

Now try running ::

   rm .figleaf
   figleaf coverage_example.py 0 0
   figleaf2html -d html-0

and

   rm .figleaf
   figleaf coverage_example.py 1 0
   figleaf2html -d html-1

and

   rm .figleaf
   figleaf coverage_example.py 1 1
   figleaf2html -d html-2

and look at the various differences.  (The -d flag specifies what output
directory to use for the annotation output.)

Coverage analysis is a useful way to target your testing efforts: code
that is not executed by any tests is, by definition, untested...
You'll see more about this in the next few weeks.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
----------------------------

(a.k.a. the Shortest Introduction to CSS You'll Ever Have)

content (HTML) vs presentation (CSS) vs behavior (JavaScript)

HTML documents consist of head and body: ::

   <html>
    <head>
    ...
    </head>

    <body>
    ...
    </body>
   </html>

The body contains the page content and is what is shown; the head contains
information *about* the page, including things like title: ::

   <title>this is my page title</title>

and CSS stylesheets to apply to this document: ::

   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

We'll play around with the example 'example.html' and 'style.css' in
the lab-10/ files directory a bit.

The book "The Ultimate CSS Reference" (Olsson & O'Brien) is very good:
see http://www.sitepoint.com/books/cssref1/

Personally I recommend using http://oswd.org/, the Open Source Web Design
site, as a source for basic CSS styles.  (Be careful of their licenses tho.)

Homework 7: Writing a Web server, part 5
----------------------------------------

Due Thursday, Oct 16th, at 12:40pm (lab start).

----

Download the new webserve test code here: ::

  http://class.ged.idyll.org/svn/files/hw-7/webserve-test.py

and modify your 'webserve.py' from HW #6 to make the tests pass.

HW #7 adds static file serving to HW #6.  Any URL not explicitly
handled by Python code (``/test/*`` and ``/auth/*``) should serve a
file from the ``files/`` subdirectory (see
http://class.ged.idyll.org/svn/files/hw-7/files/) or return a 404/file
not found error if the file does not exist or cannot be opened.  Be
sure to set the Content-Type to the appropriate MIME type for each
file based on its extension, e.g. 'text/html' for .html files.

Make sure that the top URL, '/', correctly points to 'index.html', and
that the in-line image 'standing.jpg' is properly served.

Please also make sure that your cookie handling from HW #6 works
properly with a real Web browser; that is, when running your Web
server and access the site,

 - logging in with either of the valid user/password combinations from
   the tests sets the 'user' cookie properly on your browser;

 - /auth/print properly shows which user (if any) is logged in;

 - /auth/logout properly clears the user cookie.

You can use the form included at the bottom of
http://class.ged.idyll.org/svn/files/hw-7/files/index.html to test out
your /auth/login code.

Homework 6: Writing a Web server, part 4
----------------------------------------

Due Thursday, Oct 9th, at 12:40pm (class start).

----

Download the new webserve test code here: ::

  http://class.ged.idyll.org/svn/files/hw-6/webserve-test.py

and modify your 'webserve.py' from HW #5 to make the tests pass by
fixing the URL handling for '/some/' and putting in proper cookie
handling under '/auth/'.  Put the resulting 'webserve.py' file in
'homework6/'.

I would suggest using the Cookie module
(http://docs.python.org/lib/module-Cookie.html) included with Python
to do your cookie handling, but it's not a requirement.

Note that cookie handling *should* work properly under a Real Browser
once the unittest tests work.  Let me know if it doesn't, please!

<h3>Course information:</h3>

<p>

Doing biology increasingly requires computational skills and
quantitative reasoning abilities.  This course will introduce students
to computational thinking and practice through an intensive scripting
and programming regimen, built around a series of models and data sets
from evolutionary and molecular biology.  During this course we will
introduce the Python programming language, scripting and pipelining,
simulations, and data analysis.
<p>
This course is intended for graduate students with little or no
previous programming experience.  There are no prerequisites other
than a strong background in at least one of evolution, ecology,
genetics, or molecular biology.  Enrollment by permission of
instructor only.

<hr>

<i>Objectives:</i> At the end of the course, you will have gained
basic programming skills in Python, learned basic sequence assembly
approaches, and worked with the Avida modeling system.

<p>

<i>Course structure:</i> Class will consist of in-class lectures
and discussion based around screencasts and homework.

<p>

<i>Homework and grading:</i> Individual homeworks will be graded on a
P/F basis.  Homeworks will contribute evenly to the final grade,
i.e. ~15 homeworks each worth 6 2/3%.  Group or collaborative work is
allowed and encouraged on homework, although students must each hand
in homework and are individually responsible for their solutions.

<p>

<i>Materials:</i> Most of the course will use materials developed by
Drs. Brown and Covert, which will be placed on the Web.  All such course
materials will be made available under a Creative Commons license
(CC-BY-SA 2.0), use/reuse OK but attribution required.  There is no
required textbook, but students may find "Practical Computing for
Biologists" (Haddock/Dunn) useful reference material.

<p>

<i>Attendance:</i> Attendance is generally required unless absences are
arranged in advance.

<p>

<i>Course schedule:</i>

Class will be divided into three main modules: introductory Python
programming; sequence analysis and assembly; and evolutionary modeling
with Avida.  Each module will be approximately 5 weeks.  A running
theme will be using scripting and data analysis techniques in Python
to explore data sets.

<p>

The current plan is:

<b>Programming:</b> (weeks 1-5)
<ol>
<li> Introducing Python, ipython notebook, and Amazon.
<li> More Python.
<li> Even more Python.
<li> Data analysis and plotting in Python.
<li> Running models in Python.
</ol>

<b>Sequence assembly:</b> (weeks 6-10)
<ol>
<li> Sequencing and de novo assembly -- the basics
<li> Running assembly programs
<li> Evaluating assemblies
<li> Digging deeper into assemblies
<li> Digging deeper into assemblies, round 2
</ol>

<b>Avida:</b> (weeks 11-15)
<ol>
<li> Introducing Avida
<li> Configuring Avida and analyzing Avida runs
<li> Experimental design with Avida
<li> Reading Avidians
</ol>

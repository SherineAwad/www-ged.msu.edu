<h3>Monday, November 29th</h3>

<p>

<b>Homework due:</b> Work
through <a href='http://ged.msu.edu/angus/beacon/mapping-short-reads-campy-bowtie.html'>mapping
short reads to the Campylobacter genome with bowtie</a>, and try out
various parameters with bowtie.  Choose your favorite set of
parameters (with a brief explanation of why they're your favorite),
generate the positional variation plot, and send them to Titus and
Heather.  Please do this well before class on Monday, thanks!

<p>

<h3>Friday, November 12th</h3>

<p>

<b>Homework due:</b> Avida project due!  Please write up a 2-3 page
report, in PDF, on your avida project, or prepare a 5 minute
presentation (and let us know if you are going to present).  Either the
report or the presentation should cover the following topics:
<ol>
<li> What you wanted to analyze or discover from this project;
<li> Experimental setup, with some detail on your configuration;
<li> Results;
<li> Questions, comments, or thoughts on how to set up a better experiment
next time;
<li> What you would want to do next were you to continue working on this
project.
</ol>

<p>

<h3>Monday, November 1st</h3>

<b>Homework due:</b> Use
the <a href='http://github.com/ctb/beacon/tree/master/mutation-analysis/'>mutation
analysis</a> (see also <a href='http://ged.msu.edu/angus/beacon/mutation-analysis.html'>this tutorial</a>) scripts to do a point-mutation analysis of either the
starting organism or an evolved organism.  Send in the plots as PDFs,
along with the organism source genome, to Titus and Heather.

<p>

<h3>Monday, October 18th</h3>

Work through the <a href='http://ged.msu.edu/angus/beacon/running-serial-transfers.html'>running serial transfers tutorial</a> and spend some quality time with the
<a href='http://github.com/ctb/beacon/blob/master/ltee/run-next.py'>run-next.py</a>
script, which does all the heavy lifting.  Can you run your proposed
experiment with this?  (If so, try it out!) If not, what additional
scripts or capabilities do you need?  If you need something more, talk
to Heather and Titus.

<h3>Friday, October 15th</h3>

<b>Medium homework DUE:</b> Revisit your proposed project and identify
(a) what kind of configuration files you'll start with, (b) what kind
of serial transfer you'll want to do (if any), (c) any systematic changes
you'll want to make to the configuration files during the transfer, and (d)
what kind of measurements you want to make.  Break (a-c) down into a
<i>computational pipeline</i> for doing your project, and send it to
Heather and Titus (again ;).

<p>

<b>Light homework DUE:</b> Alone or in a small group, write up a paragraph
or so with ideas for a Not-So-Long-Term Evolution Experiment with
Avida a la Lenski & Travisano.  Send to Titus and Heather before
class.  Having a hypothesis is good but not necessary.

<p>

See Lecture 10 materials (Fri, Oct 8th) for inspiration; you can also
listen to a recent MicrobeWorld

<h3>Friday, October 1st</h3>

<b>Assignment: critter-off!</b> Evolve a critter under whatever
mutation rate you want, and send it to us to battle in a gladitorial
arena!  After setting the mutation rate in avida.cfg (see: COPY_MUT_PROB),
follow <a href='http://ged.msu.edu/angus/beacon/retrieving-dominant-organism.html'>these
instructions</a> to retrieve the dominant organism.  Take this entire
last line and copy/paste it into an e-mail to Titus (ctb@msu.edu) and
Heather (hjg@msu.edu).  Due Friday, October 1st.

<h3>Friday, September 17th</h3>

<b>Assignment:</b> follow the instructions <a href='http://ged.msu.edu/angus/beacon/building-and-running-avida.html'>for installing and running avida</a>, and then copy and paste the *last line* from running avida and send it in an e-mail to the entire class at <a href='mailto:cse891@lists.idyll.org'>cse891@lists.idyll.org</a>.  The line should look something like this:
<pre>
UD: 500     Gen: 38.63245   Fit: 0.2491669  Merit: 96.38030   ...
</pre>
but yours may differ.  If you are working together, make sure you each
individually run avida and send the results out.

<p>

Note, there are a number of reasons you should not leave doing this HW to
the last minute...

<h3>Friday, September 10th</h3>
<b>Assignment:</b> Sign up for an account at <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/'>aws.amazon.com</a> and enable it for EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computing).  (If you already have an amazon.com account, you still need to sign up for AWS, but the account information will otherwise be the same.)

<p>
Briefly,
<ol>
<li> Go to <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/'>aws.amazon.com</a>.
<li> Sign up for an account.
<li> Log into the account.
<li> Click on the "Amazon EC2" tab at the top.
<li> Click the "Sign Up for Amazon EC2" button and follow the instructions.
</ol>
If you don't have to provide a credit card number and receive a phone call,
you have not successfully signed in!

<p>
You will need this to do your homework for the following Friday.  (We will provide you with a code to pay for the first $100 of computer usage, which should be enough for the entire course.)

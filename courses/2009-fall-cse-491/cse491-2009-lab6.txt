Unit testing and the 'nose' unit testing framework
--------------------------------------------------

Unit testing frameworks give you a way to organize and
run your code.  The default unittest framework that comes
with Python is unittest:

   http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html

but I prefer 'nose', "nicer testing for Python":

    http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.1/

This is installed in my account on adriatic.

You can read more about the history of unit testing here:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing

The basic idea is that you want to write and organize many small,
fairly simple tests; run them in as close to a "clean", isolated
environment as possible; and get back a useful summary of the results.

The canonical way to structure unit tests is in a class.  This class
has three types of methods: a set up method, a teardown method, and
one or more test functions.  The setup and teardown methods are generally
referred to as 'fixtures' for some reason.  Here's a simple example with
no setup or teardown functions: ::

   def add(x, y):
      "The 'function under test'."
      return x + y

   class Math_Test(object):
     def test_add_positive(self):
        assert add(2, 2) == 4

Each test function should make one or more **assertions**, statements
that some condition is true.  Here are a few more trivial examples
for 'add':

     def test_add_negative(self):
        assert add(-2, -2) == 4

     def test_add_zero_zero(self):
        assert add(0, 0) == 0

     def test_add_zero(self):
        assert add(0, 4) == 4

The setup and teardown fixtures are run before and after each test
function.  They are useful for establishing an environment in which
each test works.  For example, suppose you have an object
with some internal state, like a class that, each time you call
it, generates the next number in the Fibonacci series::

  class Fib(object):
     def __init__(self):
       self.a = 1
       self.b = 1
       self.first = False

     def next(self):
       if not self.first:
         self.first = True
         return 1

       self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a + self.b

Here is an example set of tests for that class::

   class Fib_Test(object):
      def test_first(self):
         fib = Fib()
         assert fib.next() == 1

      def test_second(self):
         fib = Fib()
         fib.next()
         assert fib.next() == 1

      def test_third(self):
         fib = Fib()
         fib.next()
         fib.next()
         assert fib.next() == 2

but here, you're creating the ``fib`` object each time you run a
function; since you need to do it for every test function, you can put
it in setup (and have teardown delete it).

   class Fib_Test(object):
      def setup(self):		# initialize
         self.fib = Fib()
      def teardown(self):	# clean up
         del self.fib

      def test_first(self):
         assert self.fib.next() == 1

      def test_second(self):
         self.fib.next()
         assert self.fib.next() == 1

      def test_third(self):
         self.fib.next()
         self.fib.next()
         assert self.fib.next() == 2

This is at least slightly neater than before (and becomes even more so
when you get to longer and more complicated setup functions).  More
importantly, it keeps code that you're *not* testing -- the creation of
objects to test, in this case -- separate from the code that you *are*
testing -- the behavior of 'fib', in this case.

The above code is in lab6/,

   http://class.ged.idyll.org/svn/files/lab6/

files 'fib.py and 'test_fib.py'.

Running your tests
==================

One thing that might be puzzling you at this point is, how do you actually
*run* this code!?  It's valid Python, but it doesn't actually contain any
code to run the tests!

That's what 'nose' is for.  Basically, you just run 'nosetests' in the
directory containing your test code, and nose figures out what code
should be run, loads it, and executes it.  It does this by looking for
files named 'test_*' or 'Test', and then looking for classes with
'test' in their names.  Then, for each function named 'test_*', it
creates an object of that class, runs setup, runs the test & records
its result, and then runs teardown.  (Among other things this lets you
add tests just by writing a new test function, which is nice.)

Here's what it looks like when you run 'nosetests::

   % nosetests
   ...
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ran 3 tests in 0.005s

   OK

Not very verbose, eh?

You can also use 'nosetests -v' to get a bit more output::

   % nosetests -v
   test_fib.Fib_Test.test_first ... ok
   test_fib.Fib_Test.test_second ... ok
   test_fib.Fib_Test.test_third ... ok
   
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ran 3 tests in 0.005s
   
   OK

What happens when you have a failing test?  After adding a failing function
'test_fourth', ::

   % nosetests
   .F..
   ======================================================================
   FAIL: test_fib.Fib_Test.test_fourth
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File ".../nose-0.11.1-py2.5.egg/nose/case.py", line 183, in runTest
       self.test(*self.arg)
     File ".../lab6/test_fib.py", line 25, in test_fourth
       assert self.fib.next() == 2
   AssertionError
   
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ran 4 tests in 0.005s
   
   FAILED (failures=1)

The idea is that unit test frameworks in general (and nose is no exception)
give you the information that *matters* to you -- what test failed -- and
ignores the "passing" tests."

One more thought -- what happens if I put in a bunch of print statements? ::

   % nosetests
   .F..
   ======================================================================
   FAIL: test_fib.Fib_Test.test_fourth
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File ".../nose-0.11.1-py2.5.egg/nose/case.py", line 183, in runTest
       self.test(*self.arg)
     File ".../lab6/test_fib.py", line 25, in test_fourth
       assert self.fib.next() == 2
   AssertionError:
   -------------------- >> begin captured stdout << ---------------------
   1
   1
   2

   --------------------- >> end captured stdout << ----------------------

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ran 4 tests in 0.006s
   
   FAILED (failures=1)

In line with my continued suggestions that you put in lots of print
statements, nose *hides* the print output for tests *unless they
fail*.  That way you can lard up your test code with all sorts of
debugging print statements, and you only see them when your code is
causing problems.  The rest of the time you can ignore htem.

So, the basic idea of unit tests is:

 - you write special test code to test your application code

 - you use a framework (like nose) that lets you just write the code
   and not worry about how to run it, how to get error reporting or
   sumamary statistics, etc.

 - you run them every time you make a change to your code.

Using tests for HW #5
=====================

If you look in hw5/, you'll see some tests:

   http://class.ged.idyll.org/svn/files/hw5/

You can use these tests to help figure out what to implement for HW #5.
The three tests do the following:

   - one checks to make sure that you're closing the socket in your
     ``handle_connection`` function;

   - one checks to make sure that the URL is being properly returned in
     the HTTP response;

   - the third checks to make sure that all of the POST data is being
     read.

To run them against your code, just run put test-webserve.py in your
directory and run ``nosetests``.  (You'll need to 'source
~ctb/python-env.csh' to use my install of nose.)

Some notes on scoping
---------------------

There are two basic scopes for variables: module-global and function-local.

For example, ::


   a = 5           # module global

   def f():
      print a      # prints module global

   def g():
      a = 10       # function local
      print a      # prints function local

Calling 'f()' will print '5', and calling 'g()' will print '10' -- and
'f()' won't overwrite the global 'a', it will just create a local 'a'.

You can get into trouble if you *use* the module-global 'a' and then
try to assign to it::

   def h():
      print a
      a = 10
      print a

because here Python can track that you're mixing module-global and
function-local statements.  If you want to assign to module-global,
declare it::

   def j():
      global a
      a = 15
      print a

which will change the global 'a'.  Note, my main suggested use for
this is in initializing things, e.g. ::

   _db_handle = None
   def init():
      global _db_handle
      if _db_handle is None:
         _db_handle = connect_to_db()

Where things get a bit tricky is with *nested functions*::

   a = 5

   def m():
      a = 10

      def n():
         print a

      return n

Here, we're defining the function 'n' in the function 'm'.  First, 'n' is
only available to those who get it from m(), and it doesn't need to be named


   fn = m()
   fn()

What do you think this will return?

How about::

   a = 5

   def m():
      a = 10

      def n():
         global a
         print a

      return n

The heck of it is, I can guess but I don't think it's worth
remembering.  This is Bad Code.  BAD CODE.  Because you have to think
about its behavior, and the answer is not clear.

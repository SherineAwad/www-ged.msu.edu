Homework 8: Serving HTML and other files
----------------------------------------

Due Tuesday, November 3rd, at 4:30pm.

1. Write a WSGI app that serves files from the disk with the appropriate
MIME types.  The app class should be importable as FileServer from apps.py,
and should take a single argument, the location of the directory from which
to serve files.  For example, after ::

     from apps import FileServer
     app = FileServer('/some/path')

the object 'app' must be a WSGI-compliant application object that
returns the contents of '/some/path/filename.html' with a MIME type of
'text/html' when the URL '/filename.html' is requested.  The app
should be a general file server, i.e. should serve files from any
subdirectory within it.  It must work on UNIX-based systems (with a
'/' path separator); Windows compatibility is optional (but easy to
achieve; apply os.path.split to the URL path and os.path.join to the
resulting list!)

trailing '/' should be served as 'index.html' within that directory, i.e.

   http://localhost:5000/

and

   http://localhost:5000/subdir/

should serve index.html and subdir/index.html, respectively.

The following filename-extension-to-MIME-type mapping should be used::

   { '.html' : 'text/html',
     '.txt' : 'text/plain',
     '.jpg' : 'image/jpeg',
     '.css' : 'text/css',
     '.js'  : 'text/javascript' }

Be sure to return a 404 for file-not-found errors, and use a default
MIME type of 'text/plain' for files with unrecognized extensions.

2. Grab an OSWD example site (oswd.org), commit all of the site files
under hw8/html/, and make sure that you can load the entire site
through your Web server.  (This may involve extending the MIME
mappings above.)  Please make this the default 'application' for your
Web server, i.e. ::

   python webserve.py 5000

on the command line should serve the 'html/' directory containing the
OSWD site at

   http://localhost:5000/

Be sure to check for errors on the server side (related to expected
files not found, etc.) as your Web browser may not show an error
message for failed file loads (e.g. small images, or bad CSS, or ...)

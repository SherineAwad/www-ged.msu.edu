Homework 7: Non-blocking WSGI and more
--------------------------------------

Due Thursday, October 29th, at 4:30pm (class start).

1. Fix your existing webserve.py from HW #6 to pass the new tests in
   test_webserve.py.  Do your best to "dogfood it", that is, modify
   your existing 'webserve.py' rather than taking my solution set.

   (2.5 points)

2. Refactor your non-blocking Web server from HW #5, 'webserve_nb.py',
   to be a WSGI server.  Make sure it passes all of the tests in
   test_nb_webserve.py.

   Also be sure that your server implementation doesn't violate
   encapsulation (i.e. there's no obstacle to having multiple Server
   objects running at the same time, each serving a different WSGI
   app).  The best way to make sure of this is to eliminate *all*
   references to module-global data structures that are used by
   Server; e-mail me the URL of your webserve.py file if you want me
   to take a quick look.

   (2.5 points)

3. Write a new set of tests against the WSGI apps in 'apps.py', and put
   the tests in the file 'test_apps.py'.  The tests should be modelled
   on test_webserve.py and test all 'if/else' branches in both apps in
   'apps.py'. (2.5 points)

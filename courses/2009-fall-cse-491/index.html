<h3>Overview</h3>

CSE 491, section 2; fall 2009, Tu 4:30 PM - 5:50 PM, 1225 Engineering (lecture); Th 4:30 PM - 5:50 PM 3353 Engineering (lab).

<p>

80 min lecture / 80 min lab

<p>

Office hours: 9:15-11:15pm Monday (the night before the homework is due)
unless otherwise stated.  Arrange private hours via e-mail.

<p>

Office:  Egr 3137 (office hours or by appointment); Giltner 318(a) the
rest of the time.

<p>

Prerequisites: CSE 232.  Knowledge of Python is strongly suggested.

<p>

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the theory and
practice of database-backed Web site development. By the end of the
course, students will have implemented a simple but complete
interactive "Web 2.0" multiuser Web site in Python with asynchronous
JavaScript (AJAX) features and an SQL database.  Students will learn
basic HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript, while gaining an understanding
of client-server programming, software architecture considerations,
automated tests, and basic software carpentry (version control, source
code management, and tools for collaboration).

See <a href='syllabus.pdf'>the syllabus</a> for more information.

<p>

Justification: database-backed Web development exposes students to a
plethora of modern (and immediately relevant) technologies.  Actually
implementing a simple Web site will introduce students to modern
network programming, client-server architecture, and software
architecture design and deployment considerations -- all practical
skills with deep underpinnings in computer science.  I'm hoping to
foster an increased awareness of effective programming tactics and
skills with this course, as well as exposing them to a variety of
technologies and theoretical considerations.

<p>

Additional topics, if they can be worked in: usability consideration;
statelessness; REST; scalability; OS/network stack; OS
process/thread/event handling; the Semantic Web; remote APIs and RPC;
trust networks; and social engineering.

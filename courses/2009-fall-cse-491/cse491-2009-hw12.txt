Homework 12: Sessions and persistence
-------------------------------------

Due Thursday, Dec 10th, 4:30pm.

1. Implement sessions for your users.  This will involve creating a
new dictionary mapping session IDs (as keys) to user IDs (values), and
storing the session ID rather than the username in the site cookie.
Be sure to have your AJAX login function from HW #11 work properly and
securely (i.e. the Web site needs to generate the session ID on login
and send it to the browser).  (2.5 points)

Note, you can generate random session IDs with the uuid module, like
so: ::

   uuid.uuid4().hex

Also note: your tests from HW #11 should all still work, right?

2. Implement data persistence for your message board using either
bsddb or sqlite3.  Messages, users, and sessions should all be
"persisted" so that when you exit the Web server & start it up again,
the meep message board has the same data in it.  (2.5 points)

Note: your tests from HW #11 should all still work, right?

3. Make sure that your meepish message board is not vulnerable to SQL
injection or XSS attacks.  Address the former by using positional
parameters for SQLite in queries.  Address the latter by using Jinja2
templating with escaping.  (If you're not using SQL, you don't need to
worry about SQL injection).  (2.5 points)

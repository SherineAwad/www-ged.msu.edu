<h3>Course information:</h3>

<p>

Doing biology increasingly requires computational skills and
quantitative reasoning abilities.  This course will introduce students
to computational thinking and practice through an intensive scripting
and programming regimen, built around a series of models and data sets
from evolutionary and molecular biology.  During this course we will
introduce the Python programming language, scripting and pipelining,
simulations, and data analysis.
<p>
This course is intended for graduate students with little or no
previous programming experience.  There are no prerequisites other
than a strong background in at least one of evolution, ecology,
genetics, or molecular biology.  Enrollment by permission of
instructor only.

<hr>

<i>Objectives:</i> At the end of the course, you will have gained
basic programming skills in Python, been exposed to a variety of
biology & evolution research that uses computation, and learned how to
use iPads to facilitate distance collaboration.
<p>
<i>Course structure:</i> Class will consist of group exercises,
lectures on various topics, and student presentations.  Most weeks,
there will be programming homework as well as a paper or two to read,
digest, and answer questions on.
<p>
<i>Homework and grading:</i> Individual homeworks will be graded on a
P/F basis.  Homeworks will contribute evenly to 80% of the final
grade, i.e. ~20 homeworks each worth 4%.  In class presentation (also
P/F) will contribute the final 20%.  Attendance will count for the
same as homework, although absences can be arranged in advance.  Group
or collaborative work is allowed and encouraged on homework, although
students must each hand in homework and are individually responsible
for their solutions.
<p>
<i>Materials:</i> Most of the course will use materials developed by
the instructor, which will be placed on the Web.  All such course
materials will be made available under a Creative Commons license
(CC-BY-SA 2.0), use/reuse OK but attribution required.  There is no
required textbook, but students may find "Practical Computing for
Biologists" (Haddock/Dunn) useful reference material.
<p>
<i>Attendance:</i> Attendance is generally required, especially since there will be in-class group projects.

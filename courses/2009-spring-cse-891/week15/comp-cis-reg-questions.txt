Computational cis-regulatory analysis (wk 15)
---------------------------------------------

Due Tues Apr 28th; please hand your answers in at the start of class.

(Last HW, hooray!)

Class notes for the week are simply the "computational approaches"
paper... I wrote it once, I don't need to write it again in outline
form ;)

1. From the Pennacchio et al. (2006) paper, what are three different
reasons that the 55% of the non-functional conserved elements might
not function as positive enhancers?

2. In the Eisen paper (Petersen et al., 2009), the authors present an
argument for why comparative sequence analysis does not work well for
finding regulatory elements in Drosophila.  This argument relies on
their statement that most non-coding DNA in Drosophila is well
conserved, but doesn't this contradict the Pennacchio paper (above),
which shows that conservation is a good guide to regulatory function?
Please suggest a way to resolve this contradiction.

(Luis should present the Cameron et al. PNAS paper. Elijah may be
briefly presenting Brown & Callan, with reference to the conservation
arguments made in Cameron et al.)

Questions on genome sequencing & assembly papers papers (wk3)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Due Tuesday, Feb 3rd, at the start of class.

1. In the MIGS paper, a distinction is made between "primary, curated
information" and "secondary, or derived, information".  What is the
difference between these types of information? (Give a concrete
example.) Thinking back to the mammalian gene content paper, what kind
of information did *that* yield and how would it fit into the MIGS
proposal?

2. The C. elegans genome paper describes the immense effort to sequence
and annotate the C. elegans genome.

If you're a bench biologist, how would (or does) having such a
resource (a well-annotated, thoroughly explored genome) change the way
you do experiments?  Note down your primary organism so I have some idea
of where you're coming from.

If you're a computational person, how would you envision making use of
the C. elegans genome sequence in building tools?  And (thinking about
the FANTOM and sORF papers from last week) how much do you trust the
biological annotations and information discussed in this paper?

(Yes, these are wishy-washy questions.  That's OK, I'm not asking for a
hard answer, either :)

Sequencing Genomes

CSE 891

Jan 28th, 2009

So, you want to know what's in a genome, eh?

Genes!

Genes
-----

Why not just sequence the genes??  (cDNA and EST projects)

 - non-coding RNA
 - regulatory DNA
 - linkages between genes and other genomic features
 - genome evolution, rearrangements
 - large-scale architecture etc.
 - all the other stuff that we *don't* know about yet...

Basically, genomes are a, if not *the*, prime component of inheritance.
If we want to know what makes a man a man and a yeast a yeast, we need
to sequence their genomes.

(...if I haven't convinced you yet that sequencing a genome isn't
*sufficient* for understanding, though, I give up on you... as you've
seen more information may lead to more confusion!)

OK... so how do you sequence a genome??
---------------------------------------

Digression: basics of cloning

 - a way to make a large amount of single-clone DNA: reliable amplification
 - take a piece of DNA, attach bacterial replication info to it, put in
   bacteria
 - can do to random bits of DNA on a large scale, and then separate out
   ("shotgun cloning")

Basics of (Sanger) sequencing

 - read 600-1000 bases into DNA *from a known starting point*, e.g.
   known bacterial sequence.  Signal degrades towards end.
 - need a large quantity of pure DNA (see cloning, above).  Relies on
   signal pileup.

Note, "genome walking" is inefficient and expensive

One way to sequence a genome:
 - subclone large bits
 - map their locations
 - sequence unique bits

Slooooow.  Frankly, it's an utterly insane way to sequence a genome
(but was once the only way!)

Had some cultural "bonuses": fit into the divide-and-conquer strategy
where each lab could be an important contributor with their *own* bit
of genome.  Bleah.

Mathematicians enter the picture: "whole genome shotgun"

Assemble based on overlaps!

Digression: sequence matching & uniqueness

probability of random match between two sequences of length L is

   1/4 ^ L (or 1/4 ** L), 1/4 to the power of L.

For L == 5, this is 1/1024: each 5-mer matches once a kb, per strand.
(For double stranded, can simply double the length of the sequence, or
double the probability: so 1/4^L * 2.)

For L == 10, this is 1 / 1048576, or roughly 1 / 1,000,000 - one in a million.

So if you can find matches of even 10 or 15 bases, you have an overlap
and you can construct a contig from two reads!

Aim for 6-20x coverage to generate more overlaps, reduce errors, etc.
Also, coverage not uniform, of course: it's random!

**Not so fast:** genomes aren't entirely random; there are sequencing
errors; there are repeats; there's natural variation.  These are
things to worry about later, though.

Some additional good tricks to help out:

Use paired end sequencing, where you *know* how far apart two pieces of
DNA should be.

Use several libraries with variable insert sizes, e.g.

  3kb library
  5kb library
  10kb library

to get coverage of difficult-to-sequence regions.

This known spacing lets you assemble based on end overlap, connect things.

"Scaffold", collection of ordered and oriented contigs with some gaps
where sequence is missing.

Why would sequence be missing!?

Problems:
 - small or large-scale repeats
 - heterochromatin
 - uncloneable sequence (bacteria don't like)
 - heterozygosity & polymorphisms

Some of these can be addressed with big insert libraries (fosmids,
BACs, YACs)

Still, uncloneable stuff; repeats; islands; etc.

Heterozygosity is a bitch: "same" sequence looks different because
of intra-species variation and/or community variation.

Various strategies for getting past this; see two polymorphism papers
(for Tuesday).  Neat bio+mathematical strategies for getting past the
issue!

Note, genome sequencing w/Sanger is *expensive*...

So you have your genome sequence... now what?
---------------------------------------------

OK... what's actually in a genome?  How do you find it?  How do you annotate
it?  What information do you want to know?  What use is it?

We will cover this a bit on Tuesday.

Question of the week: **how has genome sequencing changed biology**?

(I'll give you the skeptics view and then you can watch people shoot
me down.  It'll be fun.)

Papers
------

migs.pdf -- skim, it just talks about what sort of information you
            need to know about a genome's origin.

elegans-genome.pdf -- read as thoroughly as you can, i.e. skim with effort :)

In some ways one "bleeding edge" of genome assembly is in assembly of
polymorphic genomes, genomes with high heterozygosity.  This is
because many "real world" organisms have high heterozygosity!  (Marine
organisms esp, but really anything that can't be cultured in an
isolation chamber easily.)

Does anyone want to present these two papers?

assembly-of-polymorphic-genomes-ciona 

sea-urchin-bac-tiling

We will touch on this topic again in metagenomics and in next-gen
sequencing.

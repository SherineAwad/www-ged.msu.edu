Questions on mRNA analysis (wk 13)
----------------------------------

Due Tuesday Apr 14th; please hand your answers in at the start of class.


1. For the limb regeneration paper (Monaghan et al.), what
   mathematical technique (standardization, normalization, etc.) was
   used to compare the samples?  Separately, do you see any problems
   with the 454 quantification approach they used?

2. For the pattern detection paper (Dequeant et al., 2008), which
   method had the highest false positive rate, and how did they
   demonstrate that?  (For example, does figure 1 address the FP
   rate?)

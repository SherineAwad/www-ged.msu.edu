Large scale mRNA expression analysis (wk 13)
--------------------------------------------

CSE 891

---

Measure mRNA on a whole-cell/whole-tissue basis: time courses,
different conditions, various perturbations.

Techniques
----------

Microarrays:

 - oligo arrays
 - EST arrays
 - oligo tiling arrays

SAGE ("Serial Analysis of Gene Expression")

Next gen sequencing: DGE, RNAseq.

Issues:
 - prior knowledge, ex-post-facto knowledge
 - splice isoforms
 - dynamic range
 - sensitivity & amount of input material

What are you trying to measure?
-------------------------------

mRNA levels are relatively easy to measure, ...

...but quite a bit of mRNA isn't functional until it is translated.

mRNA level <-> protein level correspondence?  (Ming will talk about
this on Tuesday.)

What's the point?
-----------------

(First, digest into numbers.)

Clustering/covariance, "guilt by association".  What genes change together?

Gene discovery for pathways.

Looking for regulatory mechanisms (e.g. t.f. binding sites.)

Basic data processing issues
----------------------------

Standardization; relative levels.  Absolute vs relative measurements.

Normalizing: shifting the distribution to fit some standard (Is this
the same as standardization?)

Converting to rank vs using the numbers straight.   (Noise control method?)

Significance/p-value calculation??

Identifying genes and functions
-------------------------------

> 20,000 genes in an animal; how many of them do you know by name?

(Microbiologists have a slightly easier time of it - ~1-3k genes.)

Annotations on genes -- human readable, or machine readable, or both?

How do you convert?  What are the uses?

"Controlled vocabulary." -- unambiguous terminology.

Gene Ontology: ::

  [Term]
  id: GO:0016021
  name: integral to membrane
  namespace: cellular_component
  def: "Penetrating at least one phospholipid bilayer of a membrane.
     May also refer to the state of being buried in the bilayer with
     no exposure outside the bilayer. When used to describe a protein,
     indicates that all or part of the peptide sequence is embedded in
     the membrane." [GOC:go_curators]
  subset: gosubset_prok
  synonym: "transmembrane" EXACT []
  xref: Wikipedia:Transmembrane_protein
  is_a: GO:0031224 ! intrinsic to membrane

Three "namespaces": biological processes, molecular functions, and
cellular components.

Arranged in a "Directed Acyclic Graph", or DAG - each node has one or
more parents, no "cycles" (node cannot be ancestor of itelf).  This
makes it easy to computationally "digest" data and provide both
shallow/broad and deep/specific views of gene expression.

Individual genome consortia provide mappings between proteins and GO
IDs.

Issues:

 - assignment of GO function based on homology/orthology.  (...
   and paralogy/orthology issues)

 - who makes the GO annotations, and what are they based on?

     "Inferred from Electronic Annotation"

   vs

     "Inferred from Experiment"

   vs

     "Non-traceable author statement"

 - transitivity of annotations.  To quote Erich Schwarz, Wormbase:

  """
  [For IEA], ... you want to make sure that these transitive
  inferences are not, themselves, done from terms whose status is IEA
  or ISS.  Otherwise, you get into an infinite regress of GO
  annotation by similarity of X to Y, which in turn was annotated by
  similarity to Z, and Z by similarity to Theta, and ...  eventually
  you have a urochordate gene being annotated by a five-steps removed
  similarity to an *actually observed* function in Bacillus subtilis.
  And the B. subtilis paper describing this function was 20 years ago.
  And the first author was sort of delusional.  That sort of botch-up
  can really put the OHMygod into genOHMics, if you know what I mean.
  """

Any guesses as to where the bulk of GO annotations come from?

--

Open ended question: what kind of annotations do we want on genes?
Human or "machine" readable?

Questions on gene finding papers
--------------------------------

Due Tuesday, Jan 20th, at the start of class; by e-mail is fine.

(Please answer these questions with at least a short paragraph.  Try to
justify your answer; it doesn't have to be "correct" but I'd like a sense
of your thought process.)

1. The sensitivity and specificity of the SNAP gene finder (Korf, BMC
Bioinformatics, 2004) was measured on several genomes and compared to
the performance of several other gene finders.  Why are the nucleotide
numbers generally so much better than the exon numbers, and the exon
numbers better than the gene numbers?

2. Consider the improvement of GLIMMER 2.0 over GLIMMER 1.0 with
respect to resolving overlapping genes.  Given what you know about
gene start signals, and the description of how GLIMMER's parameters
are estimated from training data, what is the most likely cause of the
"false positives" for gene start signals?

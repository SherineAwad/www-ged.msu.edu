<h3>Overview</h3>

CSE 891, section 003; spring 2009, Tu/Th 12:40 PM - 2:00 PM, 1300 Engineering.

<p>

One 80 minute lecture, 2 x 40 minute student presentations each week
(3 credits).
<!-- (This course will satisfy MMG "seminar" course requirements for graduate students.) -->

<p>

Prerequisites: graduate standing in the natural sciences and/or engineering, OR
permission of instructor.

<p>

This course will introduce biologists to computational considerations,
and computational scientists to biological considerations, in the
context of modern biological "grand challenges".  Likely topics
include genome-scale annotation, comparative and regulatory genomics,
metagenomics, large-scale analysis of experimental data, phylogeny,
gene and protein interaction networks, and machine learning
techniques.  The intention is to cross-fertilize interests and
expertise, as well as expose students to considerations in large-scale
data analysis and scientific inference.

<p>

The course will be graded on reading, attendance, participation, and
presentation.

<p>

Additional potential topics: genome-scale alignments; RNAi/ncRNA; gene
finding; assembly issues; whole-genome phylogenetics; protein
structure; databases, data integration, and data warehousing.

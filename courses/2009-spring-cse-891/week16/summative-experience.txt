Biology keeps on truckin'
-------------------------

A brief timeline of some important advances in biological tools (courtesy Erich
Schwarz, Wormbase):

   1970-1980 -- development and early spread of molecular cloning 
                 and DNA sequencing, with proliferation of better tools
                 continuing until at least 1990

   1985-1990 -- invention and commercialization of PCR

   1994-1998 -- invention and development of GFP as a reagent

   1995-2001 -- shotgun whole-genome sequencing

   1997-2001 -- discovery of RNAi and miRNAs

   2005+     -- Next-gen sequencing

(I would add "microarrays" in there, too -- 1995-2005?)

We can ask more questions, and broader questions, every year.

The people, mindsets, training, and tools lag behind the cutting edge,
for obvious reasons.

One of the tools that has only gotten more important every year is
computational data analysis; each new technique generates more data,
and offers new opportunities for attacking questions based on integrated
information.

So you should know how to think about computational data analysis, even if you
don't know how to write the tools yourself; conversely, if you're interested
in writing the tools, you should know how to think about the biology.

In hindsight, my goals with this class were to:

 - expose you to a variety of genome-scale technologies and biological
   questions.

 - ...and incidentally describe some of the computational techniques used
   to analyze the results.

 - show you that both experimental and computational data have significant
   drawbacks, and you have to think about both.

 - highlight some of issues with specific types of genomic approaches and
   computational tools.

 - suggest that you want to think about what biological problem to answer,
   not (just) what technology is most convenient for you to use to do so.

If you have suggestions or comments (both GOOD and BAD) please put them on the
SIRS forms, and also send them to either George Stockman <stockman@cse.msu.edu>
or Bob Hausinger <hausinge@msu.edu>.  They'll anonymize them and pass them on
to me.  I'll appreciate pretty much anything you have to say.

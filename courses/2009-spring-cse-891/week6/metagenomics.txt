Metagenomics
------------

Est 99% of microbes cannot be cultured in a lab, either because we
don't know what they live on OR they need a partner.  Yet we know
that there are many very interesting microbial communities, and
we want to understand them.

(Think: Soil.  Gut and mouth bacteria.  Ocean communities.  Termite
guts.)

So if they do important and/or interesting things (digest cellulose;
eat our teeth; help digest food; contribute to acquired immunity; fix
nitrogen) we have a hard time studying them.

**Corollary:** we have little idea what the diversity of bacterial communities *actually is*.

"Metagenomics" -- sequencing & analyzing environmental or community
samples containing multiple genomes.

Apply Next-gen Sequencing
-------------------------

With Sanger sequencing, too expensive to sequence widely.

Still, early metagenomics practices did use Sanger sequencing: basic
subcloning & random sequencing, followed by attempts at assembly.  (See
Venter paper.)

454 technology is good for basic assessment; long-ish reads (100-450
bases), lots of them, no cloning required: just extract DNA &
sequence.

Assessing diversity with directed tag sequencing
------------------------------------------------

Sample a specific part of the metagenomes (ribosomal RNA, for example;
or a single copy gene that you think is representative) and then build
a phylogeny using those tags, or compare them all in some way.

Claim you have that many species ;).

What is a species, anyway??

 - some arbitrary cutoff -- 3%?
 - can you identify species?  or map organisms onto the phylogenetic tree of
   known bacteria, at least?

OTUs, Operational Taxonomic Unit.

What use is a species identification?
 - impressive numbers
 - may give you a hint as to likely function of species
   (or does it?)

See Sogin paper, next week.

(Is this metagenomics??)

Metagenomics -- big issues
--------------------------

Population

(Neutral) evolution & sequence swapping

What is in genomes may not be expressed
 (--> metatranscriptomics)

Kinds of analyses
-----------------

So, someone hands you 100,000 sequences that are 450 bases in length.
Now what?

Our original questions: diversity and (functional) content.

Assembly:

 - diversity can be immense; little or no idea of how much sequencing
   is required

 - high polymorphism within population (much worse than haplotype problem
   in animals!)

 - one sequencing approach: fosmid (large plasmid) creation, then
   sequencing of each fosmid (think pooled BAC approach, as in sea
   urchin)

 - can try to "paint" onto nearby genomes.
    - but what's a nearby genome?
    - what are you missing?
    - is this reliable?

Separating species by nt features

 - codon and G/C bias in organisms is quite strong, somewhat uniform across
   genome, & species dependent
 - can get "word count" statistics and try to separate sequences into
   "bins"
 - way of estimating # of species (lower bound)
 - doesn't work very well for short sequences, because signal is too low.
 - back to assembly...

De novo gene prediction

 - it didn't work in animals very well, you may recall; but it worked
   ok in bacteria.
 - now we have shorter traces...
 - I'm skeptical, but people have done it.
 - Need longer contigs
 - back to assembly...

Phylogenetic assessment with MEGAN

 - we'll cover this next week

KEGG pathway searches.

 - we'll cover this next week

Protein domain search.

 - we'll cover this next week

Challenges
----------

Lots of data.

Lots of variability.

Errors?!

Back to the original question(s)
--------------------------------

Assessing diversity.

Assessing content.

This is a very open field ;).  Most of the interesting stuff is going to
be going on in three areas, IMO:

 - functional testing of hypotheses and/or serious correlation assays
   between similar microbial environments, using metagenomics

 - metatranscriptomics

 - protein domain analysis and other "hard to discover" sequence features
   (ncRNA?)

Questions on Metagenomics (wk 6)
--------------------------------

Due Tues Feb 24th; please hand your answers in in class.

Please read the Sargasso Sea paper and the PNAS/Sogin paper for
class on Tuesday.

1. In the PNAS paper by Pernthaler et al. (2008), the authors did a
computational analysis of 454 data.  Looking at the computational part
of the supplemental material (you don't need to read the whole
paper!),

    http://www.pnas.org/content/105/19/7052/suppl/DCSupplemental

and bearing in mind some of the 454 issues we've discussed, did the
authors properly account for these issues in their computational
analysis?

2. Look at the Sargasso Sea paper, and think about the two new
Shewanella species that were identified in the paper.  What
characteristics of the data from these species suggests that they did
not, in fact, come from the Sargasso Sea?

(You'll need to look at the supplemental material.)

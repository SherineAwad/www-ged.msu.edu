Metagenomics -- big issues
--------------------------

Population

(Neutral) evolution & sequence swapping

What is in genomes may not be expressed
 (--> metatranscriptomics)

Kinds of analyses
-----------------

So, someone hands you 100,000 sequences that are 450 bases in length.
Now what?

(Note, more data generated from metagenomics than for all sequenced
bacterial genomes, as of 2007.  Now, there's even more.)

Our original questions: diversity and (functional) content.

Assembly:

 - diversity can be immense; little or no idea of how much sequencing
   is required

 - high polymorphism within population (much worse than haplotype problem
   in animals!)

 - one sequencing approach: fosmid (large plasmid) creation, then
   sequencing of each fosmid (think pooled BAC approach, as in sea
   urchin)

 - can try to "paint" onto nearby genomes by homology search.
    - but what's a nearby genome?
    - what are you missing?
    - is this reliable?

Separating species by nt features

 - codon and G/C bias in organisms is quite strong, somewhat uniform across
   genome, & species dependent
 - can get "word count" statistics and try to separate sequences into
   "bins"
 - way of estimating # of species (lower bound)
 - doesn't work very well for short sequences, because signal is too low.
 - back to assembly...

De novo gene prediction

 - it didn't work in animals very well, you may recall; but it worked
   ok in bacteria.
 - now we have shorter traces...
 - what sequence features did they use in bacteria -- and are they
   likely to be there in metagenomic data?
   (Need longer contigs)
 - back to assembly...

Phylogenetic assessment with MEGAN

 - map proteins onto known proteins with BLAST
 - look at top scoring hits & extract taxonomic identity of originating species
 - map position onto taxonomic tree and take inclusive node as "highest 
   resolution" phylogenetic assignment
 - seems to make sense when I look at the data...
 - ...but one big problem... what is it?

"Dark sequence"
---------------

~60-80% of sequence from metagenomics projects doesn't look like any known
genes when BLAST is used.

What is it??

 - new, unknown genes

   (implication: huge diversity)

 - non-genic crud

   (that's odd, most bacterial genomes seem to be full of genes... 80%!)

 - very divergent genes

Some evidence that they're divergent genes of known function.

Functional annotation
---------------------

Briefly -- how do proteins work?  (The 1000 foot view/80% correct)

Strings of functional domains attached with spacers

 - the function of proteins is tied to folding structure

 - protein sequence can often vary substantially and still be functional
   (20-30% identity => same function!)

Homology searches (BLAST) tend to work because rate of sequence change
in evolution is rather slow.  *Implication: quite a lot of sequence
conservation in proteins is "accidental", and does not necessarily
imply function.*

This also means that BLAST may not be the best way to assign function.

More sensitive searches include HMMER, which essentially uses a
position-specific scoring matrix to look at key important residues.
But it needs much more information up front... take sequence
alignments from multiple organisms, generate PSSM.

Inferring function:

Homology search with BLAST.

 - homology: orthology (speciation) vs paralogy (gene duplication)
 - often substrate specificity for enzymatic reactions is tied to
   slight functional divergence in sequence of domains, so you have to
   worry about specific thresholds.

(KEGG pathway searches.)

Protein domain search (e.g. PFAM) is a more sensitive way to detect domains.

It's also 1000s of times slower.

Most efforts saw ~30-50% assignment of function to genes
(e.g. Sargasso Sea paper).  Bork paper (2007; assigned reading for Th)
discusses techniques for additional functional assignment: all stuff
you've seen before,

 1. high similarity to, or close to, known gene of highly specific function
 2. similarity to known gene w/o highly specific function
 3. similarity to known gene of unknown function
 4. no similarity to anything known

They look only at predicted ORFs, so they eliminate lots of crappy data
at the expense of slightly higher false negatives.

Can assign ~80%, comparable to the results of their pipeline on known
genomes.

Back to the original question(s)
--------------------------------

Assessing diversity.

Assessing content.

Assessing rate of evolution!?

This is a very open field ;).  Most of the interesting stuff is going to
be going on in three areas, IMO:

 - functional testing of hypotheses and/or serious correlation assays
   between similar microbial environments, using metagenomics

 - metatranscriptomics

 - protein domain analysis and other "hard to discover" sequence features
   (ncRNA?)

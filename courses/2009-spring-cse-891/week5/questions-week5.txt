Questions on Next Gen Sequencing
--------------------------------

Due Tues Feb 17; please print out & hand in in class.

Everyone should read the Church paper and we will discuss it in class.
This is the basis for the SOLiD sequencing protocol.  There is also
some reading in the questions, below.

I'm looking for someone to present the RNAseq article on Tuesday.

Questions:

1. Read this protocol on tag-based counting of RNA molecules: ::

Now, suppose someone hands you a bunch of DGE data.  What are two
features of the data that you could use to validate a tag as "real" or
"not real"?

2. Skim the (just submitted!) paper from the Schmidt Lab here at MSU
on duplicate read issues with 454 data.  Think about what I've told
you about the 454 protocol -- what do you think is the origin of the
duplicates?  (They talk about this in the paper -- do you believe
them? ;)

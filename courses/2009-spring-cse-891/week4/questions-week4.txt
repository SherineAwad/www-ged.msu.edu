Questions on Genome Annotation
------------------------------

Due Tues Feb 10; please print out & hand in in class.

1. In class, I spoke about the idea of a per-lab system that would let
labs work privately with genome-scale data sets and annotations.  In
Lincoln Stein's paper on integration biological databases, he identifies
three kinds of integration approaches.  Which do you think would be 
a good strategy or strategies for such a per-lab system to use?

2. Pick one of the first four main computational approaches to
determining protein function computationally, and discuss a potential
drawback, either for your organism(s) of interest or with respect to
the computational technique used.

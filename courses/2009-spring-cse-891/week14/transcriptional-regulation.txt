Transcriptional regulation (wk 14)

central dogma: ::

   DNA -> RNA -> protein

Transcription is necessary for all the rest, and it is also often the
rate limiting step in development (based on experiments done in the
70s and 80s).

I'll talk about transcriptional regulation in two biological processes
in particular: microbial physiology, and developmental biology.

The basic idea
--------------

Want:

 - coordinate expression of multiple genes in response to one gene
 - logical operations (AND, NOT, OR) that process multiple inputs

Mediate through *transcription factors*

 - bind to DNA, specifically to short, degenerate "words".  Will discuss later.

 - transcription factors, when bound, either directly or indirectly promote or
   repress transcription

 - transcription factors can be "bi" (plus or minus); their action can
   depend on phosphorylation state, co-factors, relative position of binding
   sites, partners, etc. etc.

One example: lac operon / E. coli
---------------------------------

beta-gal digests lactose into glucose, permitting E. coli to use
lactose as an energy source.  lac operon is a suite of genes that
contains beta-gal.

Straight glucose is a more efficient energy source if available.

So, you want:

 - lac operon OFF (not being transcribed) when glucose is present (with or
   without lactose)

 - lac operon OFF (not being transcribed) when neither glucose nor lactose is
   present

 - lac operon ON when glucose is not present but lactose is present

Two transcription factors: lacI (negative), CRP (positive).

CRP **binds** if glucose is **not** present

lacI **binds** if lactose is **not** present

So:

 - no glucose, no lactose: lacI bound, CRP not bound
 - glucose, lactose: lacI not bound, CRP not bound
 - glucose, no lactose: lacI bound, CRP not bound
 - no glucose, lactose: lacI not bound, CRP bound

What does this actually look like?

CRP and DNA looping.

Another example: sea urchin development
---------------------------------------

cyIIIa expressed *only* in the aboral ectoderm.  One of the first genes
expressed in this territory.

How does cyIIIa get turned on in this territory??

Two mechanisms operating at different times:

 - pan-ectodermal positive gene (P1) with oral-ectoderm negative protein
   (P3A2)

 - embryo-wide positive gene with specific repressors in other territories.

Some basic regulatory "motifs"
------------------------------

AND

NOT AND

signalling interactions: "switch" behavior

Transcription factor binding sites
----------------------------------

Combinatorics

Spacing and position matter:

 - helical phasing of DNA
 - physical "space" on the DNA
 - DNA looping

Technologies for assaying t.f. binding
--------------------------------------

gel shifts ("Electrophoretic mobility shift assay")

DNAse protection assays

ChIP (QPCR; -chip; -seq)

Reporter assays.

Questions on transcriptional regulation, #1 (wk 14)
---------------------------------------------------

Due Tuesday Apr 21st; please hand your answers in at the start of class.

1. From the Stormo (2000) paper, what are the reasons for the
   so-called "binding site catastrophe"?

2. From the Setty et al. paper (2003), why might the lacZYA promoter
   have avoided the "optimal" AND/OR functionality that would be so
   easy to generate?

(Ed Kabara will present the ChIP-seq paper.)

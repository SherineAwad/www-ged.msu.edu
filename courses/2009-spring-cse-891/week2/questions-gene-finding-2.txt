Questions on gene finding papers (wk2)
--------------------------------------

Due Tuesday, Jan 27th, at the start of class; please hand in, in
class.

1. In the Hanada et al. paper on finding novel coding genes in
Arabidopsis, the abstract states: "we identified 7159 sORFs that are
likely coding sequences with the CI measure at the 1% false-positive
rate."  What do they mean by "1% false-positive rate", and do you
believe that all but 8 of the sORFs they find are "real"?  You might
also think about what other evidence they offer...

2. In the FANTOM consortium paper (Science, 2005), they define
"transcriptional units" (TUs), "transcriptional frameworks" (TKs), and
"transcriptional forests".  Can you sketch an example of a few mRNAs
that, when grouped, create one TU but multiple TKs?  Think about what
a transcriptional forest would look like, too.

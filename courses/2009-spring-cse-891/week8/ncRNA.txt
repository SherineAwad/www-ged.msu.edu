non-coding RNA
--------------

Widepread transcription (remember FANTOM paper?)

Much of transcribed sequences does not contain protein
coding sequence...?

(human genome: 1% coding, 4-9% transcribed but non-coding!)

Some spliced, some not.

Scant evidence *for* function of much of this; why?

 - difficult to detect, study

   + post-transcription effects are much harder to study than
     transcription (think modulation of protein sequence, prevention
     of translation)

   + functional "targets" may be harder to "hit" (processing of big into
     small, for example)

 - may have "tuning" effects, relatively minor phenotypes

 - may be junk, the result of noisy transcription

Function?  Complementation and reactivity: RNA can complement ss RNA/DNA.

Types of ncRNA
--------------

snRNA - small nuclear RNA

 - involved in splicing, bound up in ribonucleoprotein complexes
 - complementarity and sequence recognition?

siRNA - small interfering RNA
 - aka RNAi
 - long sense+antisense processed into short, double-stranded sequences
 - targets sequences for inhibition (plants) or destruction (animals)
 - Dicer/Argonaute
 - can *also* target transcriptional inhibition

miRNA - micro RNA
 - hairpin recognition of sequences in 3' UTR
 - target RNAse III enzymes to RNA
 - Dicer/Drosha
 - target sequences in 3' UTRs, so genes with long 3' UTRs (~50%)...

piRNA - Piwi-interacting RNAs
 - epigenetic silencing of mobile elements in the genome
 - stabilize the genome

lncRNA - large/long non-coding RNAs
 - generally mysterious ;)
 - large variety of functions: splice blocking, epigenetic silencing (Xist),
   heterochromatin nucleation, etc.
 - defined as > 200 bp, no obvious coding functionality
      (RED FLAG)

Vignettes
---------

Will cover si/miRNAs on Thursday.

piRNA, Piwi-interacting RNAs
============================

Transposons (retrotransposons and DNA transposons) hop around the genome,
disrupting function and generally being annoying.

(Big problem: ~50% of human genome is this kind of sequence!)

Mechanism for sequence evolution, but also something that must be protected
against.

The problem is that you enter a coevolutionary arms race where as immunity
to one specific transposon element emerges, the tranposon element faces
pressure to evolve away from the recognition on which the immunity is
based.  So a single protective mechanism is not sufficient.

How to deal with this?

One mechanism:

Piwi interacting RNAs (initially discovered through their association with
an Argonaute homolog in Drosophila) seem to work by "laying in wait" in
specific loci.  When transposons invade that locus, piRNA processing
takes place and RNA complementary to the transposon is produced; piRNA
is then used to target (silence) that transposon sequence throughout the
genome, both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally.  mRNA destruction
can then lead to additional piRNA-style targetting molecules.

piRNAs are germ-line associated, repeat-associated in Drosophila.

Piwi-protein knockouts in Drosophila lead to germ-line defects and
transposon mobilization.

One way they were found is that piRNAs are associated with sequences
present in "transposon graveyards", repeat-rich regions of the genome
that no longer contain functionally active transposons.

(Function in mammals is more obscure, since these piRNAs are not associated
with repeats.)

lncRNAs
=======

> 200bp, transcribed, no obvious coding.

44k transcript clusters, 180k distinct mouse cDNA molecules!

Only ~20k protein coding loci.

Three classes, roughly:

 - intergenic
 - intragenic/sense
 - intragenic/antisense

For intragenic classes, there are some clear hypotheses: complementarity
and/or processing remnants.

Complementarity is known mechanism for regulation (si/miRNA).

Estimate that ~30% of identified intragenic ncRNA are crud left over
from mRNA processing.

Intergenic is harder to understand...!?

Null hypothesis: transcriptional noise?  But, general features:

 - are they regulated in expression?
 - do they show evidence of constraint?

Constraint is expressed as preferential conservation of nt over background;
protein coding genes ~10% (90% less likely to be mutated than other
sequence), while intergenic ncRNA is ~90-95% (very weak signal).

So, probably not *just* transcriptional noise, but unclear what.

Scant specific evidence for widespread functionality, still, but new
evidence comes in every day... diversity of effects, including
heterochromatin assembly and alternative splice isoform generation.

Whence complexity?
------------------

Many organisms, vastly different apparent levels of complexity.  How??

Naive argument: it's the size of the genome.

Problem: no strong correlation between size of genome and apparent complexity
and/or phylogenetic position.  (Seems to correlate more with lifestyle,
if anything: small, rapidly reproducing organisms => small genomes.)

Naive argument #2: it's the number of genes.

Problem: Drosophila, C. elegans, and human do not have vastly different
#s of genes (15-18k, 20k).  Whups.

So...??

The RNA argument:

 There are a lot of undetected ncRNAs in the genome, and they contribute
 to substantial functional complexity.

 ... but: see lncRNA, function unknown, above.  If they are so important,
 shouldn't they be more highly conserved??  And shouldn't we have found
 them with knockout screens?

 Bottom line: evidence supporting this hypothesis is still poor.

Competing arguments:

 - the alternative splicing hypothesis: it's not the # of genes that
   matters, it's the number of different combinations of exons that
   make different proteins.

   (Some evidence for functional novelty in alternative splicing)

 - the cis-regulatory network hypothesis: it's not the # of genes that
   matters, it's the way they're deployed in combination.

   (Some evidence for this from evolutionary developmental biology,
   where a common "toolkit" of genes is used and reused in a variety
   of developmental processes.)

The debate goes on.

Some ncRNA conclusions
----------------------

On general conclusion: no evidence for RNA invading the double helix.

Why did it take so long to find??  Few strong/widespread knockout
effects; lots of nuclear RNA (introns) and mRNA to confuse the issue.
